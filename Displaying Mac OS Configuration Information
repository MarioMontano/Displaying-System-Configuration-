To display system information on a Mac OS computer, click on the apple icon on the top left of the screen and select “About 
This Mac.” You will see something similar to the display in Figure 1.3a, which displays the version of the MAC OS operating 
system that is running on the computer.

Click on the “More Info…” button, and then the “System Report” button to get a display similar to the one in Figure 1.3b. 
As you can see, this iMac is running Mac OS X 10. The processor is an Intel Core i5 running at 2.9 GHz and the iMac has 16 
Gbytes of memory. Your information may be different from that shown in the figure, depending on your hardware and operating 
system version.
